Due to shorter wavelength of 60 GHz, reflected MPCs with high power increase, and then the strong paths supporting reliable radio links are enhanced. Diversity in frequency and space dimensions are demonstrated where 60 GHz channel has high diversity orders, and has possible effective combining at end user level.
\subsection{Resource Allocation and HARQ Optimization for URLLC Traffic in 5G Wireless Network}
\label{sec:org83ff8ec}
\subsubsection{Abstract}
\label{sec:orgc0f14a6}
\begin{itemize}
\item URLLC Requirements:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Low Packet Delays (< 1ms)
\item High Reliability (\textasciitilde{}99.999\%)
\end{enumerate}
\item \emph{Downlink}\footnote{Link from satellite to ground station or transmission path from cell site to cell phone.} URLLC traffic using queuing network-based model for wireless system.
\item Effect of design choices on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item System Parameters (Bandwidth, Link, SINR(Signal to interference plus noise ratio), QoS)
\item Resource Allocation Scheme in OFDMA (Orthogonal FQ Division Multiple Access) systems
\item Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request Schemes (HARQ is combination of high-rate Fwd Error Correction and Automatic Repeat Request Error-Control)
\end{enumerate}
\item Focus on:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Minimum bandwidth to support given URLLC load scale with associated QoS constraints
\item Characterization of optimal OFDMA resource allocation schemes that maximize admissible URLLC load
\item Optimization of a repetition code-based packet re-transmission scheme.
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Introduction}
\label{sec:org6eaa4cb}
\begin{itemize}
\item URLLC Applications: Industrial Automation, Mission Critical Traffic, VR, etc.
\item Downlink transmission of URLLC traffic in FDD (Freq Division Duplex) with separate fq bands for uplink and downlink is considered.
\item QoS Requirements: Packet Size \texttt{L} bits, Max. end-to-end delay between Rx and BS: \texttt{d} secs, Probability= 1-\(\delta\).
\item Typical Values: L=32 bytes, d=1ms, \(\delta\) = 10\textsuperscript{-6}.
\item Delay includes: Queuing delay at BS, transmission duration, rx processing delay, packet decoding feedback transmission duration, time to make further transmissions.
\item Studies the impact of design choices on URLLC \emph{capacity} (load). Impact of:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Sys BW: \texttt{W}, User SINR, QoS Params \texttt{d}, \(\delta\).
\item \emph{Resource allocation} in time-fq plane of OFDMA (packets are allocated different parts of a time-fq plane for data transmission) system.
\item HARQ schemes on URLLC Capacity.
\end{enumerate}
\item A URLLC packet can be scheduled as \emph{tall} transmissions which use large W over longer d or \emph{wide} trnsms that use small W for short d.
\item Tall trnsms result in reduced tx times for packets but number of concurrent trx also reduces which might result in queuing or blocking of URLLC packets due to unavailability of W.
\item Wide trxs permit higher number of concurrent trxs but with longer trxs times for each packet which may lead to bandwidth scarcity.
\item HARQ schemes' analysis might help in evaluating max. no. of re-trxs allowed and reliability (coding scheme) to be targeted after each trx.
\item \emph{Mini-slot} level access to radio resource for URLLC with durations of 0.125-0.25 ms whereas eMBB traffic has slot durations of 1ms or more.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{5-G Network (NR: New Radio) (Ref: Intelli Resource Slicing: Deep RL approach)}
\label{sec:org675671e}
\begin{itemize}
\item Services provided:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{URLLC} (Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication): Target \emph{mission critical} communications such as autonomous vehicles, tactile internet and remote surgery. \emph{Sporadic with short packet size} and \emph{relatively low data rate}. Due to need of LL, they are localized in time with \emph{short transmission time intervals} (sTTI). Requirements: High reliability i.e. PER < 10\textsuperscript{-5} and low latency.
\item \textbf{eMBB} (Enhanced Mobile Broadband): Focus on high data rate application (4K, VR). Extension of LTE-Advanced broadband service that allows for higher data rate and coding over large transmission blocks for a long time interval. Hence, objective: \emph{High data rate with moderate reliability and packet error rate (PER) < 10\textsuperscript{-3}.}
\item \textbf{mMTC} (Massive Machine-Type Communications): Aims at serving large number of IoT devices sending data \emph{sporadically} with \emph{low and fixed uplink transmission rate}. Focus on energy efficiency.
\end{enumerate}
\item Comparison with 4G systems
\begin{enumerate}
\item In 4G systems, control signaling takes a large portion of transmission latency (0.3-0.4ms). So designing a short packet transmission system with latency of 0.5ms might cause waste of > 60\% resources for control overheads\footnote{Data that you send across a wireless network is housed in a data envelope called a \emph{packet}. Each transmission includes additional information, called \emph{overhead}, that is required to route the data to the proper location. Network control mechanisms, such as scheduling, routing, and flow control, ensure effective data transport in a communication network, but also require the exchange of network state information, such as channel conditions and queue-length information, which amounts to \emph{control overhead}. \href{http://cnrg.mit.edu/protocol-information}{REF}}.
\item To support URLLC services, changes in physical layer design of 5G NR systems have been made.
\item \emph{Physical Layer Enabler}
\end{enumerate}
\item Resource Slicing Problem: \\
Aims at maximizing eMBB data rate subject to URLLC reliability constraint, while considering variance of eMBB data rate to reduce impact of immediately scheduled URLLC traffic on eMBB reliability. DRL Approach:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \emph{eMBB resource allocation phase}: Optimization problem decomposed into three subproblems which are each transformed into convex form to obtain \emph{approximate} allocation solution.
\item \emph{URLLC scheduling phase}: DRL based algorithm is proposed to intelligently distribute incoming URLLC traffic among eMBB users.
\end{enumerate}
\item Proposed approach satisfies stringent URLLC reliability while keeping eMBB reliability > 90\%.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Network Theory for Dummies}
\label{sec:org2b631ef}
\subsection{Telecommunications}
\label{sec:orgcffa0dd}
\begin{enumerate}
\item FDM: Technique by which total bandwidth available in communication medium is divided into a series of non-overlapping frequency bands, each of which is used to carry a separate signal. (Allows for quicker transmission and parallelization). \emph{e.g. Radio, Cable TV}.
\item OFDM: Specialized FDM with the additional constraint that all subcarrier signals within a communication channel are orthogonal to each other i.e. \emph{crosstalk} between the sub-channels is eliminated and the inter-carrier guard bands are not needed which simplifies the design of transmitter and receiver. Here a separate filter for each sub-channel is not needed.
\item OFDMA: Multi-user version of OFDM, multiple access is achieved by assigning subsets of subcarriers to individual users which allows for simultaneous low-data rate transmission from several users.
\end{enumerate}
