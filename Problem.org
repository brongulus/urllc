* Rough Draft 

URLLC (Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication) targets mission critical communications such as autonomous vehicles, tactile internet and remote surgery. Packets are sporadic with short size and relatively low data rate. Due to need of low latency, they are localized in time with short transmission time intervals (sTTI). Requirements:
1. High Reliability
2. Low Latency
For this use case, the data rate is typically low and the challenge resides in designing protocols with very little overhead that exploits the available diversity to enhance
the reliability.

Existing studies regarding delay critical transmission predominantly focus on minimizing channel delay, in the scenario where multiple UEs contest for channel access and URLLC packets are prioritized over regular ones to meet delay constraints. But after that's decided there's no further optimizations made to reduce the delay for the packet while travelling through the entire network. We try to tackle this by forming an optimization problem that maximizes regular performance and minimizes transmission delay for URLLC packets while ensuring URLLC requirements are satisfied.

Since in URLLC communication, transmission requirements indicate low latency so small size packets are considered. We consider the scenario where at each node there are multiple packets arriving, the packets can be either routine (regular) or delay-critical (URLLC) packets. We represent packet arrival at a node in the network in the form of a queue. The M/G/1 queue model is considered [define state space: in terms of no. of URLLC packets at a node] where state transition happens when a packet is successfully transmitted or received.

Queueing Model Assumptions:
1. Inter-arrival time distribution: Markovian exponential?
2. Decision time: How long it takes for choosing the packet which is processed first
3. Buffer size
4. Packet size?

The packets are assumed to arrive in a <assumption> fashion. At each node in the network a decision must be made regarding which packet is processed first:
1. If there's only a single URLLC packet at a node, process it.
2. What to do if there are multiple URLLC packets from different sources? 
3. Regular packets follow FCFS schedule.


* Things to look forward to
So far, this has been focused on nodal analysis, but we need to move back a bit and look at the network as a whole, focus on computing the optimal path a packet should take at the start? Or is that decision taken node-by-node, if so the computational overhead and delay increases which is undesirable.
** Formulating the optimization problem
   1. In terms of minimum delay 
   2. In terms of reliability
   3. Urgency?
** WHY THESE ASSUMPTIONS, WHAT"S THE BASIS?
   1. What kind of network model are we looking at?
   2. What kind of application are we targeting?
   3. How is the delay computation/packet selection done, rather who does it in the network? If the routers, how would they be configured?
   4. If we're considering a graph based network
